    <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>My favorite dish to make when I have some time and am craving something that reminds me of childhood. Salty, savory, and juicy, this dish comes together easily.</p>
        <p>The sauce would also be great as a marinade. Serve this dish with rice and your favorite veggies (I like roasted brocolli.)</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Boneless skinless chicken breast</li>
        <li>Chicken Broth</li>
        <li>Onion, sliced</li>
        <li>Minced garlic</li>
        <li>Minced ginger</li>
        <li>Brown sugar</li>
        <li>Soy sauce</li>
        <li>Rice wine vinegar</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Add oil, ginger, and onions to a pan and cook until onions are soft</li>
        <li>Add garlic and cook for another minute or two</li>
        <li>Add soy sauce, chicken broth, brown sugar, and rice vinegar to pan. Stir to combine.</li>
        <li>Nestle the chicken in the sauce and add to a 350 degree oven for 20-30 minutes, or until chicken is cooked through.</li>
        <li>Remove from oven and return sauce and chicken back to stove on medium high heat. Allow sauce to bubble and reduce until it becomes a sticky, syrup like consistency. Serve over rice.</li>
    </ol>
